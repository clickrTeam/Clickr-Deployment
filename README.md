# Clickr-Deployment



## Getting started

Setup outside paths in winDeploy.py script.

May need to setup Qt.

C:\Qt\6.8.2\mingw_64\bin
"C:\Qt\6.8.2\mingw_64\bin\windeployqt.exe"
C:\Qt\6.8.2\mingw_64\bin\windeployqt.exe C:\Users\Lukew\OneDrive\Desktop\Qt\deployment  

## Running again

Run Qt build release mode -> only if keybinder changed
Run the python script -> watch for any errors
generates:
C:\Users\Lukew\OneDrive\Desktop\Qt\clickr-app\app\dist\clickr-1.0.0-setup.exe
